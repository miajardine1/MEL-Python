Methods are different than functions
- applies code to things with specific attributes
- this is probably what you would use for the jnt namer tool (change specifically joints)
- examples include temp.sort, random.uniform, cmds.xform
- you can google python string methods and get helpful stuff

Joint namer tool

User input is a string formatted like "Leg_##_Jnt"
- get selection > list of strings
    sels = cmds.ls(sl=True)
- loop through selection
    track iteration (i)
        **Clayton is trying to add to the confusion with enumerate
            for sel in sels:
            or
            for i in range(len(sels)):
            or
            for i, sel in enumerate(sels):
- find # characters
    string method count
- Count "#" symbols
- #s must be consecutive
    string method find
        find["#" * count] so it will look to see if it goes #### or whatever
            txt = "Leg_###_Jnt"
            count = txt.count('#')
            x = txt.partition("#" * count)
            print(x)
    otherwise error
    cmds.error('')

- rename
    prefix: string method find
        if you do that method, it will find the first instance of the pounds and you know where the prefix ends
    suffix
    number

Other Methods Clayton Mentioned:
